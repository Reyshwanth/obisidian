The use of UWB sensors seem to be best since their frequency and time sync leads to the least error about 0.1 - 0.3 [[Zhang - 2024 - Cooperative Positioning Based on UWB and MDS.pdf]] and there seems to be a study with the use of WiFi and RFID but the detection range is quite small. Interesting fact: water has the same resonance frequency as WiFi in 2.4GHz which leads to massive interference due to humans. The range seems to be cited anywhere between 100-300m, depending on the module. The error in localization itself using 5 drones and MDS in 3D is **0.4m** for 0.3 std gaussian error introduced into the measurement.
