**trilateration**: For instance, when an agent obtains distance estimates with respect to three anchors, the agent can infer its own position through trilateration, provided the agent knows the positions of the anchors.
In challenging environments where GPS does not work such as forest canopy etc., ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) transmission technology [26]–[28] is a promising alternative for localization [29]–[31]. UWB systems are inherently well suited for localization since the use of extremely large transmission bandwidths results in desirable capabilities such as 1) accurate ranging due to fine delay resolution; 2) simple implementation for multiple-access communications; and 3) obstacle penetration capabilities
